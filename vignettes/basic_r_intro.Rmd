***UNDER DEVELOPMENT...***

This document is a quick introduction to basic R. Audience would be users who are not familiar with R.

## R syntax

* Dot "." is valid in a variable name or a function (e.g. variable `element.subset`, function `ModelArray.lm()`)
* Syntax for formula: 
Below is an example formula:
```{r}
formula <- FD ~ age + sex
```

As you can see even though we did not define variable "FD","age" or "sex", it's a valid formula. Left hand side of "~" is dependent variable (y, or response), and right hand side includes the independent variables / covariates.


## Prepare the phenotypes data.frame: manipulations
You may want to manipulate the data.frame `phenotypes` before passing it to `ModelArray.lm()` etc functions for model fitting. Examples like de-mean and rescale covariates. R package `dplyr` is useful and easy to use for manipulation. 
```{r}
# install is first via: install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr) # load into memory
```
